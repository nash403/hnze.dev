After hours, at home, you'll often find me learning something new from a STEM YouTuber *(science, tech, engineering, math)*… or laughing (sometimes crying 👀) in front of a movie or a show.
And when I have plenty of time, I like diving into cooking projects in the kitchen 😋. I'm also your guy if you like board games!

When I'm outside, I might be out for a quick run, enjoying a beer on a terrace, or exploring different places around the world. Being in touch with other people's cultures gives me tons of inspiration both on a personal level and for my work.

I also love chilling in a café with my laptop to tackle some personal projects. [Coffee + code]{.whitespace-nowrap} never disappoints.

My friends say I'm cheerful and always up for anything!<br/>
So if you'd like to chat, about a project or just to meet, checkout the [footer :icon{name="hugeicons:arrow-down-02" .text-accent.align-middle.animate-bounce}]{.whitespace-nowrap} for my socials or simply [email me :icon{name="mingcute:mail-send-line" .text-accent.align-middle}](mailto:h.onore.nintu.nze@proton.me){.h-link.h-link-glow.whitespace-nowrap}

See you around a Latte ✨
