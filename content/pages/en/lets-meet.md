After hours, at home, you'll often find me learning something new from a STEM YouTuber *(science, tech, engineering, math)*… or laughing (sometimes crying 👀) in front of a movie or a show.
And when I have plenty of time, I like diving into cooking projects in the kitchen 😋.<br/>
I'm also your guy if you are into soccer or board games!

When I'm outside, I might be out for a quick run, enjoying a beer on a terrace, or exploring different places around the world. As a bi-national (French 🇫🇷 + Burundian 🇧🇮), being in touch with other people's cultures gives me tons of inspiration both on a personal level and for my work.

I also love chilling in a café with my laptop to tackle some personal projects. [Coffee + code]{.whitespace-nowrap} never disappoints.

My friends say I'm cheerful and always up for anything!<br/>
Meeting new people is one of my favourite parts of both travelling and being a dev. I love talking about the latest tech trends, open-source, business ideas, and all kinds of random life experiences.
