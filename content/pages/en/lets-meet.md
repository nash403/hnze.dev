# Let's Grab a Coffee Together :icon{name="line-md:coffee-half-empty-twotone-loop"}

<br/>

At home, you'll often find me learning something new from a STEM YouTuber *(science, tech, engineering, math)*… or laughing (sometimes crying 👀) in front of a movie or a show.
And when I have plenty of time, I love diving into cooking projects that require almost meditative patience.

<br/>

When I'm outside, I might be out for a run, enjoying a beer on a terrace, or exploring places and cultures that spark ideas and give me tons of inspiration for my work.

<br/>

I also love settling down in a café with my laptop to tinker with personal projects. Coffee + code never disappoints.

<br/>

My friends say I'm cheerful and always up for anything!
So if you'd like to chat — about a project or just to meet — check the footer for my socials or simply [email me](mailto:h.onore.nintu.nze@proton.me){.h-link.h-link-glow}.

<br/>

See you around a cappuccino ☕✨
